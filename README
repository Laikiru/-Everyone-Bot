Discord Bot - "@everyone Counter"
by Laikaru 3/19/2021
Originally created 2/24/2021

Objective:
> Count and display the number of times someone uses an "@everyone" in a Discord server.
> Anytime someone uses "@everyone", the bot will activate and respond.
  - ""@everyone" has been said [X] times!"

In the last line of the code, that's where you will put your bot Token.
Feel free to modify this however you like! ♡ ♡ ♡

Things to add eventually:
> Ability to read previous messages? Look for prior @everyone's to count
  - Only counts the ones it sees AFTER it's been added.
> Figure out how to upload so it's a live Discord bot lol
